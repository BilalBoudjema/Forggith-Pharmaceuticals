# Power BI Reports for Forggith Pharmaceuticals

## Project Overview

Forggith Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical manufacturing company based in Germany. They produce medical drugs and distribute them through a network of distributors. To track sales performance and support business decisions, Forggith relies on data provided by these distributors. This data is captured on a monthly basis and used for reporting and analysis.

Forggith aims to create Power BI reports to guide their sales, marketing, and operational strategies, with a focus on KPIs to drive growth and performance improvement.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a set of Power BI reports that assist Forggith in monitoring and tracking key metrics. These reports will be used by Sales Representatives, Team Managers, and the Executive team to assess and align performance against targets, and to support decision-making.
